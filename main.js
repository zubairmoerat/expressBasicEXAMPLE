// In Node.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. These functions can modify the request and response objects, execute additional code, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

// Logging: Logging information about incoming requests, such as request method, URL, and timestamp.

// Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or clients before allowing access to certain routes or resources.

// Authorization: Checking if a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource.

// Error handling: Catching and processing errors that occur during the request-response cycle.

// Request parsing: Parsing incoming request data, such as form data or JSON payloads.

// Response manipulation: Modifying the response object before sending it back to the client.
